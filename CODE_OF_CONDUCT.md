# Code of Conduct

xmpp-rs is a community whose goals are to empower people to communicate
without any form of oppression or barriers. It does so by producing material
targeted for the Jabber federated network. It promotes cultural diversity and
international cooperation.

We've drafted a list for the mediation team to use as a base when a conflict
arises. This is the kind of content that we would like not to see within our
community:

- Racist, misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic, ableist slurs, or other
  derogatory pejoratives for oppressed identity groups (unless you belong to
  that group and are reclaiming the term).
- Blatantly racist, casteist, ableist, sexist, transphobic, or otherwise
  offensive and bigoted discourse.
- Any form of stalking, harassing behavior, such as doxxing, evading blocks,
  repeated hostile messages against a user or a server.
- Symbols and slogans associated with fascist regimes and/or fascist or white
  nationalist movements.
- Pornographic and/or sexualized images.
- Pedophilia content, in all its manifestations.
- We do not accept colonialism, imperialism in all forms, and militarism.
- Promotion of capitalism or meritocracy.
- Cryptocurrencies or blockchains.
- Messages promoting or encouraging pseudoscience, conspiracism, or breaks
  with reality.
- Arguments that seek to deny or cast doubt on historic or ongoing acts of
  genocide.
- Purposeful misinformation.
- Religious proselytizing/recruitment.

Reports are to be addressed to the mediation team, which corresponds to
project maintainers if no specific team has been mandated.

This is the kind of content that we would like to see within our community:

- Assume good faith.
- Be respectful.
- Consider the space and the ability of others.

This list is not exhaustive and the mediation team may decide to take actions
disregarding the list if necessary.

A member of the community not doing anything explicitly against the Code of
Conduct may also be requested to leave if they take too much time and energy
away from the mediation team.
