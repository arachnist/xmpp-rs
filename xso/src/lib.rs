# XML Streamed Objects -- serde-like parsing for XML

This crate provides the traits for parsing XML data into Rust structs, and
vice versa.

While it is in 0.0.x versions, many features still need to be developed, but
rest assured that there is a solid plan to get it fully usable for even
advanced XML scenarios.

XSO is an acronym for XML Stream(ed) Objects, referring to the main field of
use of this library in parsing XML streams like specified in RFC 6120.
