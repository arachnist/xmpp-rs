Version NEXT:
0000-00-00 Jonas Schäfer <jonas@zombofant.net>
    * Breaking
      - We now strip trailing underscores from identifiers before constructing
        any type names we declare from derive macros.

        If you previously derived any of the macros on e.g. `Foo` and `Foo_`
        within the same scope, you can use the newly added `builder` and
        `iterator` meta keys to override the generated type names.
    * Added
      - Support for child elements in derive macros. Child elements may also
        be wrapped in Option or Box.
      - Support for overriding the names of the types generated by the derive
        macros.
