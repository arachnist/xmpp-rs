    * Breaking
      - We now strip trailing underscores from identifiers before constructing
        any type names we declare from derive macros. That means that it is
        not possible to derive the traits on `Foo` and `Foo_` if both live
        in the same scope.

        As a workaround, you can put either of these types into a `mod` and
        reexport them from the outer module. The types generated by the derive
        macro will then be scoped inside the `mod` and cannot conflict with
        the derived types on the other type.

        All this is to avoid triggering the camel case lint on the types we
        generate.
    * Added
      - Support for child elements in derive macros. Child elements may be
        wrapped in Option.
