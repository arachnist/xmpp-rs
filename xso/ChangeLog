Version NEXT:
0000-00-00 Jonas Schäfer <jonas@zombofant.net>
    * Breaking
      - The methods of `TextCodec<T>` now have `&self` receivers. This also
        implies that `#[xml(text(codec = ..))]` now takes expressions instead
        of type paths.

        Because all implementations provided by `xso` were in fact unit
        structs, this should not change most invocations, with one exception:
        The type argument of `Base64` was removed. Replace all `Base64<Foo>`
        references with `Base64.filtered(Foo)` to update your code.

        This change overall allows for more flexibility in the implementation
        of text codecs.
    * Added
      - Support for child elements in derive macros. Child elements may also
        be wrapped in Option or Box or in containers like Vec or HashSet.
      - Support for overriding the names of the types generated by the derive
        macros.
      - Support for deriving FromXml and AsXml on enums.
      - Support for extracting data from child elements without intermediate
        structs.
      - Support for collecting all unknown children in a single field as
        collection of `minidom::Element`.
      - Support for "transparent" structs (newtype-like patterns for XSO).
      - FromXmlText and AsXmlText are now implemented for jid::NodePart,
        jid::DomainPart, and jid::ResourcePart (!485)
      - Support for optional child elements, the presence of which are
        translated into a boolean (`#[xml(flag)]`).
      - Generic TextCodec implementation for all base64 engines provided by
        the base64 crate (if the `base64` feature is enabled).
