//! This module implements [Private XML Storage](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0049.html) from
//! XEP-0049.
//!
//! However, only legacy bookmarks storage from [XEP-0048
//! v1.0](https://xmpp.org/extensions/attic/xep-0048-1.0.html) is supported at the moment.
//! This should only be used when `urn:xmpp:bookmarks:1#compat` is not advertised on the user's
//! BareJID in a disco info request.
//!
//! See [ModernXMPP docs](https://docs.modernxmpp.org/client/groupchat/#bookmarks) on how to handle
//! all historic and newer specifications for your clients handling of chatroom bookmarks.
//!
//! This module uses the legacy bookmarks [`bookmarks::Conference`][crate::bookmarks::Conference]
//! struct as stored in a legacy [`bookmarks::Storage`][crate::bookmarks::Storage] struct.
