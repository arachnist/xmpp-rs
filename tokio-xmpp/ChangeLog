Version 3.5.0:
2023-10-24 Maxime “pep” Buquet <pep@bouah.net>
    * Changes:
      - Require one and only one of tls-native and tls-rust to be enabled.
        Technically a breaking change, but enabling both wasn't working in the
        previous release anyway.
      - Various fixes that were guarded under the tls-rust feature. All
        updates from dependencies.
