Version NEXT:
XXXX-YY-ZZ RELEASER <admin@example.com>
    * Breaking:
      - Remove `tokio_xmpp::ParseError` and `tokio_xmpp::starttls::ParseError` which were never used
      - Removed StreamFeatures from this crate, replaced with xmpp_parsers::stream_features::StreamFeatures (!400)
      - `starttls::error::ConnectorError` variants have been merged with `starttls::error::Error`, except `ConnectorError::AllFailed`
        which was not used and has been completely removed (!418)
      - `ProtocolError` and `AuthError` are no longer exported in crate root;
        access them from `error` module (!423)
      - `connect::ServerConnector` no longer has `Error` associated type, the methods return tokio_xmpp::Error directly,
        where Connection variant contains any error type that implements connect::ServerConnectorError (!421)
      - `starttls::Error` no longer has `TokioXMPP` variant ; only tokio_xmpp::Error can contain starttls::Error,
        not the other way around (!421)
      - `AsyncClient::new` automatically reconnects by default (!436)
      - `AsyncClient::poll_next` properly closes stream with `Poll::Ready(None)` when disconnecting without auto reconnect (!436)
      - remove `tokio_xmpp::SimpleClient` because it was not widely used, and not well documented ; if you need it,
        please let us know and it will be reintegrated (!428)

Version 4.0.0:
2024-07-26 Maxime “pep” Buquet <pep@bouah.net>
    * Breaking:
      - Add ServerConnector API to be able to change transports for the
        stream and the consumer.
      - DNS/TLS deps are now optional and available behind the `starttls-rust` and
        the `starttls-native` features.
      - Connectors for insecure tcp are now behind the `insecure-tcp` feature
        and are disabled by default.
    * Changes:
      - Add support for channel binding (RFC 9266) on TLS 1.3 (TLS 1.2
        pending) (faabc2984)
      - Prevent tokio-xmpp from crashing when the server closes the stream
        under our feet (aabd19f7).
      - New public `AsyncClient::get_stream_features` and
        `SimpleClient::get_stream_features` methods. (060088be)
      - Add `serde` feature to proxy jid feature. (034976748)
      - Add XmppCodec public. (6d449e9a)
      - Remove workaround for Debian oldoldstable. (372234b9)
      - Update to edition 2021. Remove TryFrom/Into as they're included in the
        prelude. (4089891)
      - Happy eyeballs: Connect to all records in parallel. The happy eyeballs
        implementation used not to query AAAA if it got an answer for the A
        record. (598ffdb, 6c3081d)
      - Allow building docs with --all-features. It used to fail because it's
        not possible to build with both the `tls-native` and `tls-rust`.
        features. (0298caf9)
      - Bump all dependencies.
        - Change trust-dns to hickory-dns. (115edf6f)

      - Fix typos with codespell
      - Various performance optimisations

Version 3.5.0:
2023-10-24 Maxime “pep” Buquet <pep@bouah.net>
    * Changes:
      - Require one and only one of tls-native and tls-rust to be enabled.
        Technically a breaking change, but enabling both wasn't working in the
        previous release anyway.
      - Various fixes that were guarded under the tls-rust feature. All
        updates from dependencies.
      - Add serde feature, passed to jid crate

Version 3.4.0:
2023-08-17 Maxime “pep” Buquet <pep@bouah.net>
    * Breaking changes:

      - env_logger is now included in dev_dependencies for examples debugging with RUST_LOG=debug
      - Fix debug prints to include all XML being sent and received
      - Add chosen DNS method to debug logs
      - Add syntax highlighting to debug logs
      - Update dependencies
