//! # RFC 6120 XML Streams
//!
//! **Note:** The XML stream is a low-level API which you should probably not
//! use directly.
//!
//! Establishing an XML stream is always a multi-stage process due to how
//! stream negotiation works. Based on the values sent by the initiator in the
//! stream header, the responder may choose to offer different features.
//!
//! In order to allow this, the following multi-step processes are defined.
//!
//! ## Initiating an XML stream
//!
//! To initiate an XML stream, you need to:
//!
//! 1. Call [`initiate_stream`] to obtain the [`PendingFeaturesRecv`] object.
//!    That object holds the stream header sent by the peer for inspection.
//! 2. Call [`PendingFeaturesRecv::recv_features`] if you are content with
//!    the content of the stream header to obtain the [`XmlStream`] object and
//!    the features sent by the peer.
//!
//! ## Accepting an XML stream connection
//!
//! To accept an XML stream, you need to:
//!
//! 1. Call [`accept_stream`] to obtain the [`AcceptedStream`] object.
//!    That object holds the stream header sent by the peer for inspection.
//! 2. Call [`AcceptedStream::send_header`] if you are content with
//!    the content of the stream header to obtain the [`PendingFeaturesSend`]
//!    object.
//! 3. Call [`PendingFeaturesSend::send_features`] to send the stream features
//!    to the peer and obtain the [`XmlStream`] object.
//!
//! ## Mid-stream resets
//!
//! RFC 6120 describes a couple of situations where stream resets are executed
//! during stream negotiation. During a stream reset, both parties drop their
//! parser state and the stream is started from the beginning, with a new
//! stream header sent by the initiator and received by the responder.
//!
//! Stream resets are inherently prone to race conditions. If the responder
//! executes a read from the underlying transport between sending the element
//! which triggers the stream reset and discarding its parser state, it may
//! accidentally read the initiator's stream header into the *old* parser
//! state instead of the post-reset parser state.
//!
//! Stream resets are executed with the [`XmlStream::initiate_reset`] and
//! [`XmlStream::accept_reset`] functions, for initiator and responder,
//! respectively. In order to avoid the race condition,
//! [`XmlStream::accept_reset`] handles sending the last pre-reset element and
//! resetting the stream in a single step.
