//! # RFC 6120 XML Streams
//!
//! **Note:** The XML stream is a low-level API which you should probably not
//! use directly.
//!
//! Establishing an XML stream is always a multi-stage process due to how
//! stream negotiation works. Based on the values sent by the initiator in the
//! stream header, the responder may choose to offer different features.
//!
//! In order to allow this, the following multi-step processes are defined.
//!
//! ## Initiating an XML stream
//!
//! To initiate an XML stream, you need to:
//!
//! 1. Call [`initiate_stream`] to obtain the [`PendingFeaturesRecv`] object.
//!    That object holds the stream header sent by the peer for inspection.
//! 2. Call [`PendingFeaturesRecv::recv_features`] if you are content with
//!    the content of the stream header to obtain the [`XmlStream`] object and
//!    the features sent by the peer.
//!
//! ## Accepting an XML stream connection
//!
//! To accept an XML stream, you need to:
//!
//! 1. Call [`accept_stream`] to obtain the [`AcceptedStream`] object.
//!    That object holds the stream header sent by the peer for inspection.
//! 2. Call [`AcceptedStream::send_header`] if you are content with
//!    the content of the stream header to obtain the [`PendingFeaturesSend`]
//!    object.
//! 3. Call [`PendingFeaturesSend::send_features`] to send the stream features
//!    to the peer and obtain the [`XmlStream`] object.
